  	    	<h2>Plans</h2>
          <ul>
  	    		<li>My first goal is to successfully complete the web development program, establishing solid skills as a coder and junior full stack developer.</li>
						<li>After graduation, I plan to pursue an opportunity that will allow me to continue to expand my coding knowledge and skills.  Whether that is in a start-up environment or something more established, I’m open to either at this point.</li>
						<li>Completing this program will certainly be just the beginning in terms of my education process.  While I expect lots of OJT will come in the first years of working, I’ll also be looking for additional educational opportunities to go deeper and specialize in an area or two.</li>

					<h2>Hopes and Dreams</h2>
					<ul>
  	    		<li>I love when technology is done so well that that the user is amazed by the new capability it provides.  I dream of helping to make something that truly fascinates.</li>
						<li>At some point, I would love to branch out on my own with a start-up business.  I'd love the challenge and excitement and really hope to find the opportunity to do that.</li>
						<li>I hope to have a lot of fun along the way.  I genuinely enjoy trying to make stuff and I hope to work with others that do too.</li>
